# OpenStack Heat examples

## What is "Heat"?
Heat is a service to orchestrate multiple composite cloud applications using templates.  
Each template is launched into a so called 'heat stack'.

## What are these examples for?
These heat examples are meant to assist you while getting started with cloud computing.

## Are these templates suitable for production?
This library demonstrates certain aspects of deployment with heat but does not contain complete code that is suitable for production.

## Getting Started
To work through these examples you need to install OpenStack command line clients as described here:  
http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/content/install_clients.html

or 

You can build your own environment using the [gettingStarted](gettingStarted/README.md) template.
This template is prepared to be used as a copy & paste file that you can use within the openstack dashboard. The only needed parameter is either "key_name" where you insert the name of your public SSH key or "ssh-keys" where you insert your SSH key directly.

## Support / Liability
Even if SysEleven maintains this library we do not provide support for its content.
