    Example templates from a single machine setup up to bigger 
    distributed deployment scenarios.
    Examples include usage of
    - ResourceGroups
    - FloatingIPs
    - Router and RouterInterfaces

To work through these examples you need to install OpenStack command line clients as described here:
